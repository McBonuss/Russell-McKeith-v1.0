        <h2>The History of Gorillas</h2>
        <p>
          Gorillas, also known as "Gorillas.bas", is a classic artillery game that was included with MS-DOS QBasic in the early 1990s. 
          In the game, two gorillas stand atop city skyscrapers and take turns throwing explosive bananas at each other, adjusting their angle and velocity to account for gravity and obstacles. 
          The game was a fun way to demonstrate the capabilities of QBasic and introduced many to the basics of programming and game physics. 
          Gorillas became a cult classic and is fondly remembered by retro gamers and programmers alike.
